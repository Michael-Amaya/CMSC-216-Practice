To compile the simple main.c with main.h, cd into the build directory
Run "cmake .." (Will execute instructions in CMakeLists.txt) and create what it
needs in the build directory. Then run make to actually compile the program.
CMake only creates a makefile. Then you can run ./TestApp to run the completed
program.
